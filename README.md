# sale_reporting
Hi! 
Through the analysis and processing of data from Enterprise Sales report, I am getting acquainted with and learning more about several Python libraries (Pandas, Matplotlib). To help organizations with queries about revenue, This Data reports on and analyzes over 200,000 sales data points. For the first time, mistakes will be made. If you see a mistake, do let me know so I can fix it.
